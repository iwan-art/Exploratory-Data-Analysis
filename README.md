# Exploratory Data analysis

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** is a crucial step in the analysis process that allows you to ***investigate, summarize and visualize*** data to generate ***insight*** and inform decision-making. 

EDA helps to identify patterns, detect anomalies and uncover relationships between variables, ultimately leading to the formulation of hypotheses and the selection of appropriate statistical models.

EDA is an iterative and interactive process, combining both quantitative and qualitative methods. By exploring your data visually and statistically, you can develop a better understanding of the underlying structure and characteristics of the data, which can guide you in identifying potential problems and opportunities for further analysis

### The EDA process typically consists of the following steps:
1. ***Data Collection***: The first step in any data analysis process is gathering the data. Data can be collected from various sources, such as databases, APIs, web scraping, or even manual entry.
2. ***Data Cleaning and Preprocessing***: Once the data is collected, it needs to be cleaned and preprocessed to ensure that it is accurate and ready for analysis. This step involves handling missing values, outliers, data duplicate, data entry errors, and transforming data into appropriate formats.
3. ***Data Exploration/ Analysis***: The main part of EDA is exploring the data to gain insights and identify patterns. This can be done using descriptive statistics, Analysis Univariate, Bivariate and Multivariate (Crosstab, Pivot Table, Group by, Subsetting), as well as data visualizations.
4. ***Feature Engineering***: Based on the insights gained from data exploration, you may need to create new features or modify existing ones to better represent the underlying patterns in the data. This step involves techniques such as encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical variables, and creating interaction features.
5. ***Model Selection and Validation***: AÆ¡er exploring the data and engineering features, you can use the insights gained to select appropriate statistical models for further analysis or prediction. Model validation is then performed to assess the performance of the selected models and ensure their reliability
