**Exploratory Data analysis (EDA)** is a crucial step in the analysis process that allows you to ***investigate, summarize and visualize*** data to generate ***insight*** and inform decision-making. 

EDA helps to identify patterns, detect anomalies and uncover relationships between variables, ultimately leading to the formulation of hypotheses and the selection of appropriate statistical models.

EDA is an iterative and interactive process, combining both quantitative and qualitative methods. By exploring your data visually and statistically, you can develop a better understanding of the underlying structure and characteristics of the data, which can guide you in identifying potential problems and opportunities for further analysis
